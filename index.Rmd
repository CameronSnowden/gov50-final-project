## Project thoughts

For this project, I'm interested in writing about something relating to Appalachia. I might look at some intersection of poverty, education, and opiod abuse by county throughout the region. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) has a lot of good public data on these issues, so finding data is doable once I think of a proper research question.
